This section will cover the binary search tree.

For this enhancement, I created a dashboard based off a sample dataset about employee data. The dashboard displays employee salary which can be filtered by certain departments, countries, and city. The original project did not really have an application built and it was just queries run against a dataset. The original dataset is not accessible to me, so I had to use the sample dataset.
The dashboard runs on the local server with Streamlit. Streamlit makes it easy to create a dashboard with Python and it provides several customizable options. In my case, I loaded a spreadsheet into the application and created a table showing the dataset and graphs showing the average salary. The data can be filtered by department, business unit, country, and city. When a filter is set, the data updates accordingly and the filters can be hidden.
The scenario I came up with was getting the salary information of the entire company. I created two small tables with one having the total annual salary and the other showing the average salary. This information updates along with the rest of the data as filters are set. With this project, I was able to create an interactive dashboard and created it in such a way that users can understand the data presented. With data analysis, it is important to provide users with meaningful data since these users will likely be using this to make business decisions. The data must be easily accessible, easy to understand, and dynamic based on user input.
Screenshots of the dashboard running on the browser are below:
